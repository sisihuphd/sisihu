  		<p>My research centers on strategic science communication. Specifically, I have two pipelines to maintain my scholarly productivity: 
        1) developing and testing theory-driven strategies (e.g., narrative persuasion, psychological distance) to effectively communicate 
        health and science information on various topics, such as organ donation, clinical trial, and COVID-19 vaccine; 
        and 2) analyzing and evaluating existing health and science messages, including news articles, online forums, and campaign messages. 
        I have primarily utilized quantitative methods in my research (e.g., experiment, survey, content analysis), 
        but I have also conducted in-depth interviews and textual analyses in some studies, 
        as I am aware of the important theory-building role of qualitative research approaches as well.</p>
