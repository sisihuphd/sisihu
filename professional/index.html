  		<p>My five years of industry experience as an account executive and editorial director have heavily influenced my strategic communication research and teaching. 
        As an account executive in a Shanghai-based advertising agency, I worked with clients to create persuasive advertisements and campaigns 
        (e.g., roadshow ideas and materials design, print ads, TV commercials, and promotional packages design and launch, etc.) 
        to optimize their brand images and promote their businesses. When I was an editorial director of a magazine, I took charge of the daily operation of the magazine, 
        conducted monthly surveys to understand readers' interests and needs, and initiated influential campaigns to get more subscribers. 
        For most of my professional career, I played a role as a problem-solver&mdash;striving to make a threat become an opportunity through effective and executable strategies. </p>
